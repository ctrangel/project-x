## Welcome to the projext-x Site

An interactive site with the general theme of music.
Currently we have music headlines on the home page updated weekly
A playlist page to create and display your own playlist
and a music page where you can sample songs from different genres.

We are actively working to expand the site and come up with more ideas and pages.
